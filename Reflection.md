>Explain why your way was the elegant way to do it. Address any improvements you made based on my feedback.

Answer

>Explain what, if anything, in your solution is inelegant and why you didn't make it elegant (for example, maybe you didn't have time or the knowledge to fix it).

Answer

>Finally, describe how your team collaborated on the project. What did you do together? What did you do separately? What did each team member contribute? Optionally, include a brief team retrospective: What is one thing you did well as a team? What is one thing you could have improved?

After assessing the project, we divied up the project into three components: the red bar, the UI, and the music playing. Cooper started on the red bar, Emma started on the UI, and Ben started on the music playing. After a weekend to work on our seperate parts, we all got together and combined our individual contributions into the repo's master branch. Then we started debugging. A few hours later the code was up to spec and worked as intended. We worked well as a team because we all became experts in the different parts of the code that we had worked on, and accepted suggestions from each other on how to refactor our parts of the project. We could have improved on organizing when we got together; there were miscommunications about when we were working.
